# MySQL HeatWave

This connector lets you materialize data from your Flow collections directly into Oracle MySQL HeatWave instances.

[`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mysql-heatwave:dev`](https://github.com/estuary/connectors/pkgs/container/materialize-mysql-heatwave) provides the latest connector image. For earlier versions, please follow the link in your browser.

## Prerequisites
To use this materialization connector, you’ll need the following:

- A MySQL HeatWave database and the appropriate user credentials.
- At least one Flow collection.

## Configuration
Select one or more of your Flow collections to start using this connector. The configuration properties below will help you to materialize your collections into tables in MySQL HeatWave.

## Properties

### Endpoint

| Property                | Title              | Description                                | Type   | Required/Default       |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| **`/address`**         | Address           | Host and port of the database. If only the host is specified, the port will default to `3306`.    | string | Required               |
| **`/database`**         | Database           | Name of the logical database to send data to.  | string | Required               |
| **`/user`**         | User           | Username for authentication.               | string | Required               |
| **`/password`**         | Password           | Password for authentication.               | string | Required               |
| **`/timezone`**                 | Timezone               | Timezone to use when materializing datetime columns. Should normally be left blank to use the database's 'time_zone' system variable. Only required if the 'time_zone' system variable cannot be read.  | string |                  |

### Advanced: SSL Mode
Configuring the SSL mode strengthens security when transferring data to Oracle MySQL HeatWave. Here are the possible values for SSL mode:

- `disabled`: Establishes an unencrypted connection with the server.
- `preferred`: Initiates the SSL connection only if prompted by the server.
- `required`: Establishes an SSL connection but doesn’t verify the server’s certificate.
- `verify_ca`: Connects via SSL connection and verifies the server’s certificate against the provided SSL Server CA, without validating the server's hostname. SSL Server CA is mandatory for this mode.
- `verify_identity`: Ensures an SSL connection, and verifies both the server's certificate and hostname. This is the highest level of security. SSL Server CA is required for this mode.

### Bindings

| Property                | Title              | Description                                | Type   | Required/Default       |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| **`/table`**            | Table              | The name of the table to send data to.     | string | Required               |



## Sample

```yaml
materializations:
  ${PREFIX}/${MAT_NAME}:
    endpoint:
      connector:
        image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mysql-heatwave:dev
        config:
          database: flow
          address: localhost:5432
          password: secret
          user: flow
    bindings:
      - resource:
          table: ${TABLE_NAME}
        source: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```

## MySQL HeatWave on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

This connector supports cloud-based MySQL HeatWave instances hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). 

### SSH Tunneling (Required)
You are also required to configure SSH tunneling by providing the following:

- **SSH Endpoint**: Enter the endpoint of the remote SSH server that supports tunneling (formatted as `ssh://user@hostname[:port]`).
- **SSH Private Key**: Input the full RSA Private Key for SSH connection.
